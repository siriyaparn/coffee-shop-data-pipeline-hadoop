# Data Engineering Project: End-to-end Hadoop
This project is from [Road to Data Engineer](https://school.datath.com/courses/road-to-data-engineer-2-0-2023) course. Road to Data Engineer is a course that provides fundamental to advanced knowledge in the Data Engineer track. We can apply this knowledge to build automated data pipelines.

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a data pipeline for a coffee shop using Hadoop architecture to process and calculate daily member card points for running campaigns and promotions. It also intends to send real-time data when a customer places an order, allowing the back office system to quickly check the latest order.

### Hadoop System Design

- Batch Layer: Handles offline data processing tasks, typically for historical data
- Speed Layer: Deals with real-time data processing

## Getting Start
### Seting-up Google Compute Engine (Optional)
